        <h2> Excerpts from What do Prototypes Prototype & Programming Design Systems</h2>

        <p class="big"> Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. All in all, digital products all share a common trait: They are created with programming languages.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> I pick this quote because I agree with the statement. To truly demostrate the experience and see if the product is viable, we need to cost the most realistic prototype for testing. I am enjoying this class because I am learning ways to make my vision come to life. Although I am not a coder, I am learning how to better have a conversation about my vision with coders.</p>

        <p class="big"> However, there is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> This is actually something that I have been thinking about and the reason why I decided to go back to school. I would like to become an expert in prototyping tools. However, another main goal of mine is to understand AI, how it works, and training. It is because AI is climbing fast and taking over the industry; however, so few people that look like me are in the rooms for the creation. I am not a programmer nor do I plan to become one. However, if I can understand the tools, I can give value input in the creation process and can even low fedilty prototype the experience.</p>  

        <p class="big">What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them,but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.</p>
        <p><em>-What do Prototypes Prototype?</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> I picked this quote because I actually think it is misleading with it. I think that media or tool does matter. I am not going to use blender for an AI project lol</p>

        <p class="big">Many graphic design schools have resorted to teaching a waterfall philosophy where students are positioned to think of themselves as creatives who come up with ideas for others to build. After all, this is easier than adopting a whole new set of processes. However, the fundamental problem with this approach is that static design tools like Illustrator and Sketch fail at prototyping digital systems. </p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> Although this class is my hardest class, i do appreciate learning how to code and prototyping. It is vital for what I do since I design digital products. I am definitely going dive in and learning prototyping tools and learn how to code from Codecademy.</p>

        <p class="big">To design well, designers must be willing to use different tools for different prototyping tasks; and to team up with other people with complementary skills.</p>
        <p><em>-What do Prototypes Prototype?</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> I agree with this! I know pick and choose which tool I want to become an expert in. Honestly, p5.js is extremely hard to me. I do want to learn AI but I need to research easier tools for prototype.</p>

        <p class="big">Define “prototype” broadly. Efficient prototypes produce answers to their designers’ most important questions in the least amount of time.</p>
        <p><em>-What do Prototypes Prototype?</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> I agree with this statement. It reminds me of user testing. We conduct those to get th emost accurate answers about the digital experience. It allows to validate the experience, discover blocks, and new information. This certainly can able to all prototypes.</p>
