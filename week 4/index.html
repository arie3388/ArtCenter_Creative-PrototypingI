        <p class="big"> Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. All in all, digital products all share a common trait: They are created with programming languages.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> However, there is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big">What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them,but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.</p>
        <p><em>-What do Prototypes Prototype?</em></p><br>
        <p class="big">Many graphic design schools have resorted to teaching a waterfall philosophy where students are positioned to think of themselves as creatives who come up with ideas for others to build. After all, this is easier than adopting a whole new set of processes. However, the fundamental problem with this approach is that static design tools like Illustrator and Sketch fail at prototyping digital systems. </p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big">To design well, designers must be willing to use different tools for different prototyping tasks; and to team up with other people with complementary skills.</p>
        <p><em>-What do Prototypes Prototype?</em></p><br>
        <p class="big">Define “prototype” broadly. Efficient prototypes produce answers to their designers’ most important questions in the least amount of time...We define a prototype as any representation of a design idea—regardless of medium; and designers as the people whocreate them—regardless of their job titles.</p>
