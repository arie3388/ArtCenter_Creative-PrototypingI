           <p class="big">Since I am a novice to Blender, I decided to do three tutorials: (1) redoing the tree from class, (2) my attempt to design a cup, and (3) design a cup from another tutorial because the first one came out horrible.</p>

           <p class="big"> Next, I attempted to design a cup from a tutorial on Youtube. I failed at using the Bevel tool because I wanted to improvise on the stem. Also, my finish was not smooth. I probably should have use more of the loop cut to smooth out the cup.</p>

           <p class="big">Again, I tried to design a cup again using another tutorial. This time is was a success. I did not add because it was complex to follow. I was able to easily follow the Modifier tool and started to understand the differences between edges and faces. Trying to freestyle my design, the cup came out a lil crooked.</p>

           <p class="big"> From this exercise,  I am learning that repetition creates perfection.</p><br>

        <p class="big"> Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. All in all, digital products all share a common trait: They are created with programming languages.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> However, there is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big">What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them,but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.</p>
