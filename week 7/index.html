        <h2>Protyping with Blender</h2>
        <time> November 7, 2023 </time>
       <p>Learning Blender in three weeks definitely presented its challenges. However, the process taught me how to observe my product in the environment and include the experience within my prototype.</p><br>
       <p> My first challenge was designing a physical experience associated with my FEMA project. At first, I was looking at buildings and abandon houses to showcase the situational awareness ascept. However, I am an absolute beginner to Blender, so my professor pushed me to design a physical product to assocate the FEMA worker while they are on the field. I was inspired by designs of vest with large pouch, so I decided to design a vest that allowed the FEMA worker to carry his iPAD while multitasking and being hands free whem needed.</p>

       <p> First, I explored tutorials to help me create the vest. For the most part, it was easy to follow; using the physics tool to sew the vest presented diffculty becuase it is a lot of physics element that I have not studied in probably twenty years. With the time constraint, I pivot to focus on the pouch component.</p>

       <p> My professor worked me through a low fidelty on a way to design it. First, I used the cube to build out the pouch, using extude (E), sizing (S), and rotate (R). Then, I measured it to the vest.econdly, I design a rope-like structure to controll the flap of the vest.</p>

       <img src="vest9.jpg" alt="Adding rope"br>
       <p> I downloaded the ipad from blenerkit and added it inside the pouch. All of this took about a day and a half to two days.</p>
       <p> Once I was satisfied with the pouch design. I went pack to play with the vest. I could not get the sewing feature in the physics component to create a former fiting vest, so I started to manipulate it using the perspective tool.</p>

       <p> Once I was satisfied, I began to explore the materials. I was looking for a thick police officer vest material, but I could not find it. I played with the army camo fabric. FEMA workers primarily wear blue so I created a blue monochromatic camo.</p>

       <p> For the controller, I followed Apple's asthetic, using a black rubber material, and I added rope-like material. </p>
       <p> I went back to thickness the vest using the extude (E) option.</p>

       <p> I tried to add my designs in but my computer continuously shutdown. I will add it to the blog once my laptop always me too!</p>

           <h2> Learning Blender</h2>
           <time> October 17, 2023</time>
           <p class="big">Since I am a novice to Blender, I decided to do three tutorials: (1) redoing the tree from class, (2) my attempt to design a cup, and (3) design a cup from another tutorial because the first one came out horrible.</p>

           <img src="tree2.jpg" alt="Final tree design"br>
           <p class="big"> Next, I attempted to design a cup from a tutorial on Youtube. I failed at using the Bevel tool because I wanted to improvise on the stem. Also, my finish was not smooth. I probably should have use more of the loop cut to smooth out the cup.</p>

           <img src="cup1.jpg" alt="First attempted cup"br>
           <p class="big">Again, I tried to design a cup again using another tutorial. This time is was a success. I did not add because it was complex to follow. I was able to easily follow the Modifier tool and started to understand the differences between edges and faces. Trying to freestyle my design, the cup came out a lil crooked.</p>

           <img src="cup2.jpg" alt="Second attempted cup"br>
           <p class="big"> From this exercise,  I am learning that repetition creates perfection.</p><br>

        <h2> Excerpts from What do Prototypes Prototype & Programming Design Systems</h2>

        <p class="big"> Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. All in all, digital products all share a common trait: They are created with programming languages.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big"> However, there is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.</p>
        <p><em>-Programming Design System</em></p><br>
        <p class="big">What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them,but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.</p>
